# tedxreg

This is just a small form for getting the registration of the people for a mini event, for example, this particular one is for registering the attendees for a mini tedx event.
This is designed so that google form is would not be used as it does not looks very professional.
Even though this also does not looks very professional, so that's the reason it is on GitHub as a public repository.

Guys....Do you magic....
